Create a student schema with name, contact, subjects, class, society, year in mongo, such that : 
1. each student can have multiple subjects and can be in a single class 
2. Each student can be part of  multiple or none societies.
(HINT:Dynamic fields to be added as per the user's 
input: create a request updating the schema on input, 
by entering society field)
Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. 
As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.
 1. each student can have multiple subjects and can be in a single class 
 2. Each student can be part of  multiple or none societies.
create a route for registering student, 
student needs to be part of class, but being part of society is optional,
each class can have multiple societies
create three separate schema, society, class, student. 
A student can be in many classes or one, a student can be in no society or many. 
so hierarchy is class==> society==> student, where society is dynamic(ie 0 to many)
Aggregate queries:
 no.of students who have registered today for theatre society from class science
 2. students above the age 15, who have registered for swimming society in arts and science class
